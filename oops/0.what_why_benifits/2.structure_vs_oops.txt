Why use classes instead of structures: 

Classes and structures are somewhat the same but still, they have some differences.
For example, we cannot hide data in structures which means that everything is public
and can be accessed easily which is a major drawback of the structure because
structures cannot be used where data security is a major concern.
Another drawback of structures is that we cannot add functions in it.


// OOPs - Classes and objects

// C++ --> initially called --> C with classes by stroustroup
// class --> extension of structures (in C)
// structures had limitations
//      - members are public
//      - No methods
// classes --> structures + more
// classes --> can have methods and properties
// classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
// structures in C++ are typedefed
// you can declare objects along with the class declarion like this:
/* class Employee{
            // Class definition
        } pankaj, rohan, lovish; */
// pankaj.salary = 8 makes no sense if salary is private
