/*
Constructors in C++: 

->A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class.
->The constructor doesnâ€™t have a return type.
->Constructors are used to initialize the objects of its class. 
->Constructors are automatically invoked whenever an object is created.

Important Characteristics of Constructors in C++: 

->A constructor should be declared in the public section of the class
->They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created
->They cannot return values and do not have return types
->It can have default arguments
->We cannot refer to their address
